    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section class="intro">
        <p>James Clerk Maxwell was a Scottish physicist whose groundbreaking work in electromagnetism laid the foundation for much of modern physics. His famous Maxwell's equations are considered one of the cornerstones of classical physics, and his theories led to the development of technologies like radio, television, and lasers. Maxwell's work bridged the gap between electricity, magnetism, and light, paving the way for later discoveries such as Einstein's theory of relativity.</p>

    <!-- Tab Contents -->
    <div id="early-life" class="tab-content active">
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>James Clerk Maxwell was born on June 13, 1831, in Edinburgh, Scotland, to John Clerk Maxwell, a lawyer, and Frances Cay, his mother. His father passed away when Maxwell was only eight years old, leaving him in the care of his mother and family. Maxwell was a shy child but showed an extraordinary interest in reading and mathematics from a young age. His talent for understanding complex scientific concepts became apparent early on.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="education" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Maxwell was educated at the University of Edinburgh, where he was introduced to mathematics and natural philosophy. He later moved to the University of Cambridge, where he developed his scientific ideas and established himself as a promising young physicist. At Cambridge, Maxwell became a fellow of Trinity College, where he honed his mathematical skills and was mentored by some of the best scientific minds of the time. He was deeply influenced by Michael Faraday's work on electromagnetism.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="career" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>After completing his education, Maxwell held various academic positions. He was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy at King's College London in 1860, where he began his most important research into the nature of electricity and magnetism. Maxwell's work on electromagnetism led to the famous Maxwell's equations, which describe how electric and magnetic fields interact. He also worked on the kinetic theory of gases, explaining the motion of molecules in a gas, and developed the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="legacy" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Maxwell's contributions to science have had an enormous impact. His equations paved the way for Einstein's theory of relativity and are the foundation of modern physics. Maxwell's work on the nature of light, which showed that light is an electromagnetic wave, changed our understanding of the universe. His influence extended to the fields of optics, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics, and he is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 19th century.</p>
